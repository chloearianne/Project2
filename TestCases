Things to write test cases for:

  
		//invalid symbols/input in general
			null string
			p
			(p=>q)          //doesn't have a reason
			* p
			p=>q
			8896
			@#$
			>
			null string
			show (p=>q)         a     //ends with a character, checks if the parser ends early
			sowh (p=>q)				  //incorrect spellings
			show					  //reason not followed by expression
			
			
			//extra spaces
			      show     (p=>p)         //spaces behind as well
			s how p
			show (  p=  >q)
			
		
		//Uses of show
			//not beginning the proof with a show
				TheoremSet myThms = new TheoremSet();
				Proof p = new Proof(myThms);
				//ie. try to start with:
				p.extendProof("assume p")
				print p
				mp p
				and1 p
				repeat 0
				
		
		
		//Uses of assume
			//cannot assume what you're trying to prove
				show (p=>q)
				assume (p=>q)
				
				show p
				assume p
				
				show ((b=>c)=>(a=>c))
				assume ((b=>c)=>(a=>c))
		
		
			//cannot assume things on the right hand side
				show ((b=>c)=>(a=>c))
				assume (a=>c)
			
			//test 2 assumes in a row
				show (p=>q)
				assume p
				assume q
				
				show (p=>q)
				assume p
				assume p
			
			//assume does not follow show
				show (p=>q)
